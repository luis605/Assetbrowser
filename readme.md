# RayGui Template

This is a template for using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [Imgui](https://www.github.com/ocornut/imgui) together. To achieve this it uses the [rlImGui](https://github.com/raylib-extras/rlImGui.git) library.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run ``cmake -B ./build .`` in the root directory
3. Run ``cmake --build ./build`` in the root directory
4. Run ``make run`` in the build directory

This will automatically download the required dependencies from git and build the project.
